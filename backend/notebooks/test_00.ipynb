      "The sky is blue because of a phenomenon called **Rayleigh scattering**. Here's a breakdown:\n",

      "*   **Sunlight is a mixture of all colors:** Sunlight appears white to our eyes, but it's actually composed of all the colors of the rainbow (red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere:** When sunlight enters the Earth's atmosphere, it collides with tiny air molecules (mostly nitrogen and oxygen).\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Scattering of light:** This collision causes the light to scatter in different directions.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Rayleigh scattering favors shorter wavelengths:** Rayleigh scattering is more effective at scattering shorter wavelengths of light. Blue and violet light have shorter wavelengths than other colors like red and orange.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **Why not violet?** While violet light is scattered even more than blue light, there are a couple of reasons why the sky appears blue:\n",
      "\n",
      "    *   **Sunlight emits less violet light:** The sun emits less violet light compared to blue light.\n",
      "    *   **Our eyes are less sensitive to violet:** Our eyes are more sensitive to blue light than violet light.\n",
      "    *   **The upper atmosphere absorbs some violet:** Some violet light is absorbed by the upper atmosphere.\n",
      "\n",
      "*   **The result:** Because blue light is scattered more effectively and is more abundant in sunlight and easier for our eyes to see, we perceive the sky as blue.\n",
      "\n",
      "**Think of it like this:** Imagine throwing a bunch of marbles (sunlight) at a bunch of tiny pins (air molecules). The smaller marbles (blue light) are more likely to bounce off in different directions, while the larger marbles (red light) are more likely to go straight through.\n",
      "\n",
      "**What about sunsets and sunrises?**\n",
      "\n",
      "At sunrise and sunset, the sunlight has to travel through more of the Earth's atmosphere to reach our eyes. This means that most of the blue light has already been scattered away by the time the light reaches us. The longer wavelengths, like red and orange, are able to penetrate through the atmosphere more easily, resulting in the beautiful colors we see during sunsets and sunrises.\n"
